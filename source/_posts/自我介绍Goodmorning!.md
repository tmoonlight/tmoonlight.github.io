　Good morning !

　　It is really my honor to have this opportunity for a interview,

　　Now i will introduce myself briefly

　　I am 26 years old,born in hubei province .

　　I was graduated from yangtze university. my major is computer science and techology.

　　and i got my degree after my graduation in the year of 2010.

　　In the past years. I spend most of my time on techology study . 

　　In July 2009, I begin work for a foreign company as a software  engineer in shanghai city.Because I'm capable of more responsibilities, so I decided to change my job.

　　And in August 2011,I left QingDao to BeiJing and worked for a foreign enterprise as a automation software test engineer.Because I want to change my working environment, I'd like to find a job which is more challenging. Morover Motorola is a global company, so I feel I can gain the most from working in this kind of company ennvironment. That is the reason why I come here to compete for this position.

　　I think I'm a good team player and I'm a person of great honesty to others. Also I am able to work under great pressure.

　　That’s all. Thank you for giving me the chance.
